" To get hover working in the terminal we need to set ttymouse. See
"
" :help ttymouse
"
" for the appropriate setting for your terminal. Note that despite the
" automated tests using xterm as the terminal, a setting of ttymouse=xterm
" does not work correctly beyond a certain column number (citation needed)
" hence we use ttymouse=sgr

" Suggestion: By default, govim populates the quickfix window with diagnostics
" reported by gopls after a period of inactivity, the time period being
" defined by updatetime (help updatetime). Here we suggest a short updatetime
